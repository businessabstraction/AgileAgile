# The Assumptions
Before Agile we had two methods:
 - Trust Me
 - Waterfall

The Trust Me method is to get talented people, and trust them to develop what you need. If you have people capable of that you are unlikely reading this site, so we will ignore it further on. 

The Waterfall methods requires you to produce a series of specification documents, each of the document except for the first created on the basis of the previous document. Eventually code is written on the basis of one of the documents, and the system is done. 

The key assumption here is that at each stage someone can determine correct and precise answer. A Business Architect can find out from the executives precisely what the business needs. A Business Analysts will find out from the Business Domain Experts how the system should operate. An Architect will figure out an efficient high-;evel design for the solution. 

For any minimally innovative project such Assumption is simply wrong. The executives have little understanding of the fundamental change new technology can bring. The expert "from the factory floor" have gripes about existing systems. The Architect, unless repeating something that worked a decade ago, is relying on a sales pitch. Every document contains effors, unproven (and orten incorrect) hypotheses, guesses and arbitrary statements. All that is passed as an input to the next document, which will add own noise. 
# The Agile Approach
The Agile approach is based on several principles:
1. All you can write are hypotheses
1. Don't try to get validation and signatures at that stage. Work on the basis of those hypotheses, and get validation as early as you can.
